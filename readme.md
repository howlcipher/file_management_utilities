# File Management Utilities

This repository contains Python scripts for file management tasks such as copying/deleting files from folders based on specified conditions and logging the copying/deletion process.

## Description

The repository consists of several Python scripts:

1. **by calander**: These scripts focus on being configured with date information contained within the file name.

2. **by_filename_and_location**: These scripts focus on the filename itself matching characters contained within it or the directory.

3. **copy_payment_history_files**: These are application specific for file management
